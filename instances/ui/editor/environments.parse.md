# Environments

Currently Zesty.io maintains 2 envrionments for you; dev and live. Each has its own set of HTML, stylesheets, and Javascript files.

## Dev (Previewing Changes)

The in development changes can be previewed with the instance preview URL. This preview URL can be used with clients when sharing in development work for approval.

### Preview Access

Access to the preview URL can, optionally, be limited to specific IP addresses or a range of IP addresses. Preview URLs can also be locked to only load for logged in users with access to the instance.

## Live (Publishing Changes)

In the development environment, template files can be individually edited and published to production. There is also a "Publish All" button to send all development file changes live at the same time.
