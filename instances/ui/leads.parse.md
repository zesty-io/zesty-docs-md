# Leads

### Overview

If a form submission is posted to a Zesty.io hosted website with an input value for `zlf`, Zesty.io will automatically store all the submitted data. The Leads section is where that stored data can be interacted with.

> The Leads section will be automatically display once a lead is stored with your Zesty.io instance.

### Navigating the Leads Section

Leads are shown in a paginated table that shows the date, email, first name, last name, and form group for the captured submissions.&#x20;

> Please note that while all of your lead form's data is not shown in the table, the CSV export will show all the form fields' data.&#x20;

Each row in the table is clickable and clicking on a row will show a snippet of the leads detail.

Another option is form group. The form group's name comes from the [`zlf` value](https://zesty.org/guides/how-to-create-a-lead-form#zesty-io-lead-form) which is set when the form created in the view.

### How to Connect forms to ZLF

To configure a form to use Zesty.io's leads table, three items need to be true. First, the form needs to be using the `POST` method. Second, the form action needs to be to a relative path. Third, the form needs to include an input with a name attribute of `zlf` and a non-empty `value`.

Here is an example:

```
<form method="post" action="/thank-you/" >
          .........
         <input type="hidden" name="zlf" value="Contact Page Form" />
          .........
</from>
```
