### Page

A Single Page will create a template layout with a unique URL. These will display with a single page view in the Content section. A Single Page can be reused as a template for multiple pages but will only be called once using Parsley in the Editor.

See examples of single pages listed below.

* Homepage &#x20;
* Landing Page &#x20;
* Contact Page

### Page Group

A Page Group creates a grouped collection of pages. These pages will each have their own URLs and display as a table under the Content section with each page from the Page Group as a row in the table. A Page Group can be called out as a set in Parsley in the Editor. Every page within a Page Group will share a single template layout using Parsley in the Editor.

See examples of Page Groups listed below.

* Blog posts &#x20;
* Articles &#x20;
* Products &#x20;

### Data Sets

A Data Sets does not generate a template layout nor unique URLs. An Data Sets creates a collection of entries available globally within Parsley. Each Data Set is displayed as a table with each data entry as a row in the table. A Data Set can be nested under a Page or Page Group by assigning a parent when initially created.

See examples of Data Sets listed below.

* Categories &#x20;
* Slides &#x20;
* FAQ's
