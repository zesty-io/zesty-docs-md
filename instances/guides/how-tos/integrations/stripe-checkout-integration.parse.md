# Stripe Checkout Integration

### Get Started

Stripe Checkout makes collecting a fee or donation easier than ever.

First, make sure you set up your API Keys in the Stripe Settings:

Once you've set up your API keys, you can add the necessary code:

You should see a button that looks like this:

When clicked it will bring a modal that looks like this:

Note: Zesty will automatically use your test Stripe API key if you are on the development preview URL (the one that looks like abcdef-dev.preview.zestyio.com).

After the card details are submitted the user will be redirected to the URL you specify in the `success_redirect` value (if successful), or to the `failure_redirect` URL if unsuccessful.

### Example #2: Variable Amount Donation Form

### Example #3: Subscribe to a Recurring Stripe Plan

Note that the endpoint for the form `action` is slightly different (`/-api/stripe/subscribe`).

### Example #4: Subscribe to a Plan with a Custom Amount

This is a workaround for Stripe having set plan prices. If you submit a new subscription (via Zesty) with a interval of `month` and a price of `999`. It will check if a plan `monthly-9.99` exsits. If it doesn't, it will create it. Either way, it will create a new subscription to that plan. See the below the code example below. Note: the endpoint for this is also slightly different (`/-api/stripe/subscribe-custom`).
