# How do Instance or Blueprint LESS Variables Work

Plate-Variables describe how the LESS Variables in the CONFIG tab are constructed. It creates placeholder content about how the variables work as well as the type of variables you have access to.

### How Variables Work

There are a few default variables in each template (there is no limit to how many you can add). The four default variables are dropdown, color, text, and image. These variables help get you started and stay consistent when creating your site.
