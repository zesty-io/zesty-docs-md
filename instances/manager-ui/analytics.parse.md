# Analytics

### Overview

The Analytics section allows users to view some Google Analytics (GA) in a dashboard in Zesty.io. If a user hasn't authenticated Zesty.io with Google they will be prompted to do so. Once authentication has been completed the some GA the interface will show some analytics and graphs.&#x20;

GA authentication is optional. It purpose is to simply display some useful information so a user can view the data directly in Zesty.io instead of having to login to another application to view them.&#x20;

**Note:** only users with owner, admin, and developer roles can set up analytics.
