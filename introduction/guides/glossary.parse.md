## Media Section

Used for groups of like pages that share a parent page like articles or team members.

## Parsley

Parsley is the contextual templating language of Zesty.io. Parsley is used inline with HTML and other markup languages to dynamically reference content and data from the Content section of Zesty.io. Parsley uses double curly braces or braces `{{ }}` to open and close template expressions. Inside these braces a developer can use Parsley functions, reference content schema properties, and create database queries. These templating expressions are written alongside standard HTML.

## Site Crawler

Site Crawler will check your site for any bad links and suggest ways to fix them. You can find it in the Health Section.

## Snippet

A snippet is a file in the Editor that contains a piece of code that is abstracted from a view(s). Snippets are often used for repetitive pieces of code such as a header or footer and for complex pieces of codes to simplify a view. To add a snippet in a view use the [Parsley include](https://zesty.org/services/web-engine/introduction-to-parsley/parsley-index#include) call.
