# React

## Remote Example

This React app pulls data from Zesty.io endpoints to show the simplicity of using the platform. The example consumes the Homepage and Menu endpoints from Zesty.io for a simple example.

## Local Example

Identical to the remote example in almost every way, the local example pulls the data from Zesty.io before each build and stores it locally. It takes advantage of a simple script that pulls the data from Zesty.io
