# Blueprints

### Overview&#x20;

Blueprints consist of an XML plate, which serves as the basis for the Schema structure, as well as a styles, JavaScript, and view files, and sometimes sample content.&#x20;

Users can only manage Blueprints if the blueprint setting is switched on via their user account settings.&#x20;

We'll review the Blueprints interface below.&#x20;
